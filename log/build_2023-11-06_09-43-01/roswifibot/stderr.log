[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlib_wifibot.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "lib_wifibot", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "lib_wifibot" with
  any of the following names:

    lib_wifibotConfig.cmake
    lib_wifibot-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "lib_wifibot" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "lib_wifibot_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "lib_wifibot" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
